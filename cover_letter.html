    <section>
      <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>
      <p>I am writing to express my interest in a technology-focused position at your organization. With several years of hands-on experience in operations technology, network installation, and IT support, combined with my ongoing Bachelor of Science in Information Communication Technology at the University of Kentucky, I am confident in my ability to contribute to your team and support your organization’s technical infrastructure.</p>
      <p>In my current role as an Operations Technology Professional with McTribe Restaurants, I install and maintain networking and POS systems across 29 locations, provide live technical support, and create customized Windows system images to ensure consistent and reliable deployments. I have also led technology integration for a new store from the ground up, coordinating with vendors, managing installation timelines, and ensuring successful implementation of all technical systems. These experiences have strengthened my ability to troubleshoot technical issues, manage multiple projects, and work effectively with both technical and non-technical personnel.</p>
      <p>In addition to my technical experience, I bring strong problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and a proactive approach to improving system reliability and efficiency. I have implemented organizational improvements such as a technology work order escalation system and conducted training seminars to help team members better understand and utilize technical systems. My technical skills include Windows administration, networking, databases, Linux, Python, HTML, and IT support, and I am currently pursuing CompTIA A+, Network+, and Security+ certifications to further strengthen my expertise.</p>
      <p>I am especially drawn to opportunities where I can apply my technical knowledge in a hands-on environment, troubleshoot systems, and help organizations operate more efficiently through reliable technology. I am highly motivated to continue learning, expanding my technical skills, and contributing to a team that values innovation and operational excellence.</p>
      <p>Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience and skills align with your organization’s needs.</p>
      <p>Sincerely,<br>Xander Schroeder</p>
